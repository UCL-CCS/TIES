TIES is a python library for the relative binding
free energy (RBFE) calculations.

TIES superimposes ligands and prepares the input 
files for molecular dynamics simulations. 
These simulations can be carried out with 
either NAMD or OpenMM using the package [TIES_MD](https://ucl-ccs.github.io/TIES_MD/).

For the details about the protocol and its
validation please refer to the following publications
