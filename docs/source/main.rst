TIES
====

**TIES** is a python library for the relative binding free energy (RBFE) calculations.

Specifically, TIES superimposes ligands and prepares the input files
for molecular dynamics simulations. These simulations
can be carried out with either NAMD or OpenMM
using the package `TIES_MD`_.

For the details about the protocol and its validation please refer to the following publications::

.. note::

    TIES20 is validated and uses continuous testing. However, it is under active development
    and minor changes in the interface can take place. Any feedback and raised issues are appreciated.
